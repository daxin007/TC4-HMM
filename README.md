# TC4-HMM

Projects in a Machine Learning class to learn how to implement HMM order 0, 1 and 2

brown.save.p is the file that is used in tp1.ipynb and tp2.ipynb. It is opened with pickle instead of loading the original file from the nltk database.

tp1.ipynb is an implementation of a "HMM order 0".

tp2.ipynb is an implementation of a HMM order 1.

Projet.ipynb has a HMM order 1, a HMM order 2 and two tries to handle noisy insertions and deletions for HMM order 2.

unsupervise_learning.ipynb is a tentative to implement unsupervised learning for HMMs, but isn't working well as of yet.
